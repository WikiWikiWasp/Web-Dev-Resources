# Web-Dev-Resources
A simple list of resources that might be useful to us (TXST CS students) since the Internet Software Development course is pretty much dead in the water. Help me build out the list for future students and as a reference after graduation! *(Initial emphasis was on python/django as that is the current course content, but feel free to add any web related language/framework resource!)*
